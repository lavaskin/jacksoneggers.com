		<h2><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #ffd700;margin-right: 0.5rem;"></i> Looking For Work!</h2>

		<p>
			On May 26th of 2023, I was laid off from my previous position as a Software Engineer for EtherForm Inc. due to a shortage of work. I was hired initially
			to work on two contracts we were aiming for. We only won one contract, and that client's needs didn't match our expectations.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am open to all kinds of roles from web development to embedded systems. I am also open to relocation, but would prefer to stay in the beaverton area,
			or better yet, work remotely. I am also open to contract work, but would prefer a full-time position.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please <a href="mailto:me@jacksoneggers.com" tabindex="0">send me an email</a> if you have any questions or would like to talk about a position.

		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>
			I started my programming passion in high school with a class in game development.
			That interest led me to getting a bachelor's in applied computer science at <a href="https://oregonstate.edu" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Oregon State University</a> in 2021.
			After graduating, I started working at a local company to grow my technical skills and learn more about the industry. You can see more about my experience <a routerLink="/experience" tabindex="0">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			I enjoy starting up personal projects in my freetime relating to things that interest me or my friends, as well as 
			learning new technologies and languages. I also enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and working on my cars.
