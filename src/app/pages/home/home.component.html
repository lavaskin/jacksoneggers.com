		<h2><i class="fas fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #ffd700;margin-right: 0.5rem;"></i> Looking for new Opportunities!</h2>

		<p>
			Looking for full-time positions relating to software development, specifically web development positions or general engineering. I am highly skilled with Angular but open to using or learning other frameworks as well as other technologies unrelated to web development.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I am in the Portland, OR area and can work in-person, but I'm mostly looking for a fully remote position, or at a minimum, a hybrid position. I can also relocate if needed.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Please <a href="mailto:me@jacksoneggers.com" tabindex="0">send me an email</a> if you have any questions or would like to discuss a relevant position.

		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>
			I started my programming passion in high school with a class in game development.
			That interest led me to getting a Bachelor's in Applied Computer Science at <a href="https://oregonstate.edu" target="_blank" tabindex="0">Oregon State University</a> in 2021.
			After graduating, I started working at a local company to grow my technical skills and learn more about the industry. You can see more about my experience <a routerLink="/experience" tabindex="0">here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			I enjoy starting up personal projects in my freetime relating to things that interest me or my friends, as well as 
			learning new technologies and languages. I also enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and working on my cars.
